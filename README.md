## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate software developer based in the United States, currently working at [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/). My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity and a constant desire to build solutions that make a difference.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or delving into the world of sci-fi (yes, my username is indeed inspired by the desert planet from Dune!).
